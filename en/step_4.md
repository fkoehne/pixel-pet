## Draw your Pixel Pet

First you'll need to design your pet avatar before you program any actions. [Here are some examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpHFQXoISWc) to give you an idea! You can also print [this worksheet](files/printable-worksheet.pdf) to help you design your pixel pet.

- Open a Terminal by clicking on **Menu**, **Accessories** and **Terminal**.
- Type `cd RPi_8x8GridDraw` and press **Enter** on the keyboard.
- Next, type `python3 sense_grid.py`. This will run an application which you can use to draw your space pet avatar.

- Simply select the colour you wish to use from the grid with your mouse pointer, and then select the circle in the grid to change it to that colour. 

- Alternatively, you may wish to draw your picture out on squared paper with coloured pencils instead like this:

- You will need another pet design, preferably one that is very similar to the first, so that we can animate your pet. Here you can see the image is almost identical to the one above, but the feet are in a different place:

	Later, when you code your animation, you will create the illusion that the pet is walking.
