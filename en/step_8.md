### What next?
--- challenge ---
What else can you do with your pixel pet?
- Why not create a few more pet images, and functions to animate them? You could make it so that when the pet is shaken in one direction, one animation is played, and shaking in a different direction causes a different animation to be played.
- How about changing the speed of the animation, depending on how hard the pet is shaken?
- What other sensors could you use to affect your pet? Could you make it look like it's shivering when the temperature drops?
