## Create a `walking` function

The code you have written that animates your pet now needs to be placed inside a function. This will allow you to trigger the code when an action is performed.

Have a look at the section below if you are unfamiliar with Python function. Then place your loop inside its own named function. In the example below, the function is called 'walking'.

You can create a function by using the key word `def` followed by the name of the function, and then by `():`. Your loop can then be placed below the function definition, which means it's inside the function. Note that for this to work, you need to indent the lines of code of your loop.

Here's a little bit of code to help you out:
```python
def walking():
    # code goes here
    # make sure it's indented!
```
