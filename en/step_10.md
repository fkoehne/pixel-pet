## What next?

- Do you need to make use of the `sense.clear()` function to make your program work the way you want?
- What other sensors could you use to trigger functions that are on the Sense HAT? Can you create more actions in order to look after your space pet, like feeding or petting?
- Could you make a dice or Simon Says game like the ones in the [Getting Started with the Sense HAT resource](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/)?
