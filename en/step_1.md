##  Introduction

Using sensors and output devices is a great way to make your computer programs more interactive. The Raspberry Pi Sense HAT contains a whole set of sensors that can be used to detect movement. In this resource, you will use these to take a digital pet for a walk. You can watch a video tutorial for the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfRDFvEVz-w&rel=0){:target="_blank"}.

## What you will learn

By creating your very own interactive pixel pet with code you will learn how to:

- Use variables and lists in Python to display an image on the Sense HAT LED matrix
- Use for loops and while loops to repeat instructions
- Create a function in Python
- Use the Sense HAT's accelerometer to detect movement and trigger some code

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/){:target="_blank"}:

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator){:target="_blank"}
- [Apply basic programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder){:target="_blank"}
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder){:target="_blank"}
