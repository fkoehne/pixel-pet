By creating your very own interactive pixel pet with code you will learn:

- How to use `variables` and `lists` in Python to display an image on the Sense HAT LED matrix.
- How to use `for loops` and `while loops` to repeat some instructions.
- How to create a `function` in Python.
- How to use the Sense Hat's accelerometer to detect movement and trigger some code.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
